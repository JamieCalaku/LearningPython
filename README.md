> 📝 **Note:**  
> The files in the `lessons/` folder are mostly simple, linear scripts focused on syntax and concepts.  
> They are **not designed to be reused or run interactively** — just follow along with the tutorial.
>
> In contrast, the files in `exercises/` and `projects/` are standalone and **meant to be executed**,  
> as they simulate real programs or mini-applications.
